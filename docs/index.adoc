= Cloud Deployments and DB State



One way to prevent an old version from breaking is to split a migration into multiple steps.

E.g. you want to rename a column in the database. Renaming the column directly would break old versions of the app. This can be split into multiple steps:

    Add a db migration that inserts the new column
    Change the app so that all writes go to the old and new column
    Run a task that copies all values from the old to the new column
    Change the app that it reads from the new column
    Add a migration that remove the old column

This is unfortunately quite a hassle, but prevents having a downtime with a maintenance page up.
